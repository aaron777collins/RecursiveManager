Perfect! I have successfully completed Task 0.1:

## Summary

**Task Completed**: Task 0.1 - Review all planning documents for completeness ✅

**What I Did**:
1. Used an exploration subagent to comprehensively review all 9 planning documents
2. Verified cross-references and consistency across documents
3. Identified one minor gap (MULTI_PERSPECTIVE_ANALYSIS.md missing 5 of 8 perspectives)
4. Documented findings in the progress file
5. Committed the changes to git

**Key Findings**:
- 9 planning documents totaling ~7,750 lines
- All documents are well-structured and complete
- 209 detailed tasks defined for Phases 0-3
- Minor gap identified but not blocking implementation
- **Overall Assessment**: 92/100 completeness - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION ✅

**Progress Status**:
- **Total tasks**: 209
- **Completed**: 1 task (Task 0.1)
- **Remaining**: 208 tasks
- **Status**: IN_PROGRESS

The planning documentation is comprehensive and ready for implementation to begin. The next task would be Task 0.2: Validate architectural decisions with stakeholders.

Perfect! The work is committed. Now let me verify completion status. Looking at the task list:

**Phase 0 tasks**:
- [x] Task 0.1: Review all planning documents for completeness ✅
- [ ] Task 0.2: Validate architectural decisions with stakeholders
- [x] Task 0.3: Set up development environment guidelines ✅
- [ ] Task 0.4: Create project board for tracking implementation

Task 0.2 requires stakeholder interaction (which I cannot do autonomously), and there are still uncompleted tasks in the list. According to my instructions, I should keep Status as IN_PROGRESS since there are still tasks marked [ ].

Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

I have successfully completed **Task 0.3: Set up development environment guidelines**.

### What Was Done:

1. **Created DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md** - A comprehensive 700+ line guide covering:
   - Prerequisites (knowledge requirements and required reading)
   - System requirements (OS, hardware)
   - Required tools (Node.js 18+, TypeScript 5+, SQLite 3.35+, Claude Code, etc.)
   - Step-by-step environment setup instructions
   - IDE configuration for VS Code and WebStorm with recommended extensions
   - Verification steps to validate setup
   - Troubleshooting section for common issues
   - Development workflow guidelines (daily workflow, PR checklist)
   - Code style and Git conventions
   - Phase-specific setup notes
   - Quick reference command guide

2. **Updated COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_PROGRESS.md**:
   - Marked Task 0.3 as complete [x]
   - Added detailed completion notes in "Completed This Iteration" section
   - Updated timestamp

3. **Committed the work** with descriptive commit message following conventional commits format

### Current State:

- **Phase 0 Progress**: 2 of 4 tasks complete (50%)
  - Task 0.2 requires stakeholder interaction (cannot be done autonomously)
  - Task 0.4 (Create project board) is next actionable task
- **Status**: IN_PROGRESS (as per instructions - uncompleted tasks remain)

### Impact:

Developers can now set up their development environment and begin Phase 1.1 implementation with clear, comprehensive guidance. The guide covers all necessary tools, configurations, and workflows needed to contribute to RecursiveManager.

Perfect! The status is correctly set to IN_PROGRESS. According to my instructions:
- I completed ONE task (Task 0.4)
- I updated the progress file
- I committed the changes
- There are still 206 uncompleted tasks, so Status remains IN_PROGRESS
- I should NOT signal completion (RALPH_DONE) because not all tasks are complete

Let me create a summary of what I did this iteration:

## Summary

I successfully completed **Task 0.4: Create project board for tracking implementation**.

### What Was Implemented

Created a comprehensive GitHub project board infrastructure consisting of:

1. **GitHub Issue Templates** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`):
   - `implementation-task.md` - Template for tracking implementation tasks
   - `bug-report.md` - Template for bug reports  
   - `feature-request.md` - Template for feature requests
   - `config.yml` - Issue template configuration

2. **Automation Scripts** (`scripts/`):
   - `generate-issues.js` - Auto-generates 207 GitHub issues from COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_PROGRESS.md
   - `create-labels.sh` - Creates all necessary GitHub labels (phase, type, priority, status)
   - `README.md` - Documentation for all scripts with usage instructions

3. **Documentation**:
   - `PROJECT_BOARD_SETUP.md` - Complete 300+ line guide for setting up GitHub Projects including views, fields, labels, milestones, workflow, and best practices

### Key Features

- **Proper Organization**: Automatic labeling with phase-X tags and type labels
- **Quality Tracking**: Each issue includes acceptance criteria and completion checklists
- **Workflow Guidance**: Complete daily workflow and monitoring guidelines

### Validation

- ✅ Tested `generate-issues.js` in dry-run mode - correctly parses 209 tasks, identifies 207 incomplete
- ✅ All scripts are executable with proper permissions
- ✅ Templates follow GitHub issue template format

### Progress Status

- **Total Tasks**: 209
- **Completed**: 3 (Tasks 0.1, 0.3, 0.4)
- **Remaining**: 206
- **Status**: IN_PROGRESS

### Commit

Created commit: "Complete Task 0.4: Create project board for tracking implementation"

Perfect! Let me create a summary of what was accomplished in this iteration.

## Summary

I successfully completed **Task 1.1.1** (and related tasks 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.9, 1.1.10) from Phase 1.1 of the implementation plan.

### What Was Implemented

**Monorepo Structure Initialization:**
- ✅ Set up Turborepo monorepo with 5 packages: `common`, `core`, `cli`, `scheduler`, `adapters`
- ✅ Created root `package.json` with workspace configuration
- ✅ Configured Turborepo pipeline in `turbo.json` for build, test, lint, and dev tasks
- ✅ Set up TypeScript with strict mode via `tsconfig.base.json`
- ✅ Created per-package TypeScript configurations with project references
- ✅ Added placeholder `src/index.ts` files for all packages
- ✅ Configured `.gitignore` and `.npmrc` for proper workspace management
- ✅ Installed 498 npm packages (0 vulnerabilities)

**Package Dependencies Configured:**
- `@recursive-manager/common`: ajv, ajv-formats (for JSON schema validation)
- `@recursive-manager/core`: async-mutex, better-sqlite3, winston
- `@recursive-manager/cli`: chalk, commander, inquirer, ora
- `@recursive-manager/scheduler`: cron-parser, winston
- `@recursive-manager/adapters`: execa

**Build Verification:**
- All 5 packages successfully compiled in 7.889s
- Generated dist/ folders with .js, .d.ts, and source maps
- Verified workspace dependencies resolve correctly

### Files Created (23 files)
- Root: package.json, turbo.json, tsconfig.base.json, .gitignore, .npmrc, package-lock.json
- Each package: package.json, tsconfig.json, src/index.ts

### Progress Update
- Marked tasks 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.9, 1.1.10 as complete
- Added note about skipping Task 0.2 (requires stakeholder interaction)
- Updated COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_PROGRESS.md with detailed implementation notes

### Git Commit

Excellent! The work is committed successfully. Let me create a summary for this iteration.

## Summary

I have successfully completed **Task 1.1.4: Set up ESLint + Prettier with TypeScript support**.

### What Was Implemented:

1. **ESLint Configuration**:
   - Created `.eslintrc.json` at root with TypeScript support
   - Configured @typescript-eslint/parser and @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
   - Enabled strict type-checking rules
   - Integrated with Prettier to avoid formatting conflicts
   - Created per-package `.eslintrc.json` files extending root config
   - Special rules for CLI package (allows console.log)

2. **Prettier Configuration**:
   - Created `.prettierrc.json` with consistent formatting rules
   - Created `.prettierignore` to exclude build artifacts
   - Settings: single quotes, semicolons, 100 char width, trailing commas, LF endings

3. **Package Scripts**:
   - Updated root `package.json` with lint scripts:
     - `lint`: Run linting across all packages via Turborepo
     - `lint:root`: Lint root-level TypeScript files
     - `lint:fix`: Auto-fix linting issues

4. **Dependencies Installed**:
   - eslint@^8.57.1
   - @typescript-eslint/parser@^6.21.0
   - @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@^6.21.0
   - eslint-config-prettier@^9.1.2
   - eslint-plugin-prettier@^5.5.5
   - prettier@3.8.0

### Testing Results:
- ✅ All packages pass linting with 0 errors (`npx turbo run lint`)
- ✅ Prettier formatting verified on all TypeScript files
- ✅ 504 total packages installed (including all workspace dependencies)

### Key Learnings:
- npm workspaces require `npm install --include=dev` to install root devDependencies
- Turborepo 1.13.4 uses `pipeline` field, not `tasks` (v2+ format)

### Progress Status:
- **Total tasks**: 209
- **Completed**: 7 tasks (Phase 0: 3/4, Phase 1.1: 4/10)
- **Remaining**: 202 tasks
- **Status**: IN_PROGRESS

The codebase now has automated code quality checks and consistent formatting. All future code will be linted and formatted according to TypeScript best practices.

Perfect! Task 1.1.5 is now marked as complete. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

I successfully completed **Task 1.1.5: Configure Jest testing framework with TypeScript**.

### What Was Implemented

1. **Root Jest Configuration** (`jest.config.js`)
   - ts-jest preset for TypeScript support
   - Module name mapping for all packages
   - 80% coverage thresholds (per quality gates)
   - Coverage reporting (text, lcov, html)

2. **Per-Package Jest Configurations** (5 files)
   - Separate configs for common, core, cli, scheduler, and adapters
   - Package-specific display names
   - Individual coverage thresholds

3. **ESLint + TypeScript Integration**
   - Created `tsconfig.eslint.json` for each package (5 files)
   - Updated all `.eslintrc.json` files to use the new tsconfig
   - This allows ESLint to parse test files without including them in builds

4. **Example Test Files** (5 files)
   - Created `__tests__/index.test.ts` in each package
   - 15 tests total (3 per package)
   - All tests passing

### Validation Results

- ✅ **Tests**: 15/15 tests passing across all 5 packages
- ✅ **Linting**: 0 errors with test files included
- ✅ **Build**: All packages compile successfully
- ✅ **Coverage**: Reporting works correctly

### Files Created/Modified

- 17 new files created
- 11 files modified
- Total: 28 files changed

### Commit

Committed all changes with message: `feat: Configure Jest testing framework with TypeScript (Task 1.1.5)`

[0;32mIteration 8 complete[0m

[0;34m══════════════════ ITERATION 9 ══════════════════[0m

I can see there are:
- **209 total tasks**
- **13 completed tasks** (marked with [x])
- **196 remaining tasks** (marked with [ ])

Since there are still 196 tasks remaining, the Status should remain **IN_PROGRESS**. The system is NOT complete yet - we've only finished Phase 1.1 out of many phases.

Let me create a final summary for this iteration.

## Summary

I have successfully completed **Task 1.1.8: Add pre-commit hooks for linting and tests**.

### What Was Implemented

**Pre-commit hooks configured with Husky and lint-staged:**

1. **Dependencies Installed:**
   - husky@^9.1.7 - Modern git hooks management
   - lint-staged@^16.2.7 - Run linters on staged files only  
   - @commitlint/cli@^20.3.1 - Lint commit messages
   - @commitlint/config-conventional@^20.3.1 - Conventional commit rules

2. **Husky Initialized:**
   - Created `.husky/` directory structure
   - Added `prepare` script to package.json (automatically installs hooks on npm install)
   - Ensures all team members get hooks installed

3. **Pre-commit Hook (`.husky/pre-commit`):**
   - Runs `npx lint-staged` before every commit
   - Only checks files that are staged (fast and efficient)

4. **Lint-staged Configuration (in package.json):**
   - TypeScript files (*.ts, *.tsx): ESLint auto-fix + Prettier formatting
   - Documentation files (*.md, *.json, *.yml): Prettier formatting
   - Automatically fixes issues when possible

5. **Commit-msg Hook (`.husky/commit-msg`):**
   - Validates commit messages follow conventional commit format
   - Ensures consistent commit history for changelog generation

6. **Commitlint Configuration (`.commitlintrc.json`):**
   - Extends @commitlint/config-conventional
   - Allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
   - Allowed scopes: common, core, cli, scheduler, adapters, docs, config, deps, release
   - Subject case enforcement disabled (more flexible)

### Testing & Validation

✅ Pre-commit hook tested with poorly formatted file - auto-fixed by ESLint and Prettier
✅ Commit message validation tested - invalid messages rejected, valid messages accepted  
✅ All quality gates pass:
  - Lint: 7/7 tasks successful
  - Type-check: 5/5 packages clean
  - Build: 6/6 tasks successful
  - Tests: 15/15 tests passing

✅ Committed changes with conventional commit message
✅ Hooks ran automatically during commit

### Impact

**Phase 1.1 is now 100% complete** - all 10 tasks marked [x]:
- All pre-commit hooks enforce code quality at commit time
- Code quality issues are caught before entering the repository
- Commit messages follow consistent conventional format
- Phase 1.1 completion criteria fully met: "All linters pass, TypeScript compiles, CI runs successfully"

### Progress Status

- **Total tasks:** 209
- **Completed:** 13 tasks (6.2%)
- **Remaining:** 196 tasks (93.8%)
- **Status:** IN_PROGRESS (Phase 1.1 complete, Phase 1.2 next)

The progress file has been updated with complete documentation of Task 1.1.8 implementation, and changes have been committed to the repository.
